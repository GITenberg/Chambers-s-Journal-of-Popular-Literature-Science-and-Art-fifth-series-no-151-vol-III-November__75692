<p><span class="smcap">Antiquaries</span> are always delighted to remind us
that there is nothing new under the sun. When
we boast of the great European art of printing,
they bring in the Chinese as evidence against
us. Certain it is, however, that the Romans used
movable types to mark their pottery and bread,
and even to indorse their scroll-books. But if
this is to be called printing, then the Accadians,
and their successors the Assyrians, did the like
on a grand scale many centuries before. To the
last-named people, moreover, must be ascribed,
so far as we at present know, the invention of
a magnifying lens of rock-crystal, a thing so
well made, that Sir David Brewster pronounced
it a true optical instrument. It was found amid
the ruins of Nimroud by Layard.</p>

<p>It is curious to see also how great natural laws
have been dimly apprehended centuries before
they were rendered demonstrable. The law of
gravitation was undoubtedly discerned by Sir
Isaac Newton; but it is remarkable that in
Cary’s translation of Dante’s <i>Inferno</i> an idea very
like it occurs, namely:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">Thou wast on the other side, so long as I</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Descended; when I turned, thou did’st o’erpass</div>
<div class="verse indent0">That point, to which from every part is dragged</div>
<div class="verse indent0">All heavy substance.</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>Of this passage, Monti remarks that if it had
met the eye of Newton, it might better have
awakened his thought to conceive the system of
attraction than the accidental fall of an apple.</p>

<p>For fifty or sixty years before any real light
was thrown upon the nature of gravitation, Pedro
Mexia of Seville had a clear and correct idea of
its action. Thus, in his <i>Silva de Varia Leccion</i>
(published in 1542, and which in various translations
was in great demand until the middle of
the seventeenth century), the following appears:
‘The sky is above in all parts of the earth, and
the centre of the earth is below, towards which
all heavy things naturally tend from whatever
side of the earth; so that if God had made a
hole, which by a true diameter passing through the
whole earth, from the point where we are, as far
as the other opposite and contrary to this, on the
other side of the earth, passed through the centre
of it: then if one dropped a plummet, as masons
do, know that it would not pass to the other side
of the earth, but would stop and place itself
in the centre of it; and if from the other side
one let fall another, they would meet together
in the very centre, and there they would stop.
It is quite true that the force might well cause
the plummet to pass somewhat beyond, because
its movement, so long as it was going towards
the centre, would naturally be accelerated, passing
somewhat beyond, but in the end it would return
to its place.’</p>

<p>Of this old Spanish work, an English translation
was made by T. Fortescue, and printed in
London in 1576, entitled <i>The Forest, or Collection
of Historyes, no less profitable than pleasant and
necessary</i>. Another appeared in 1613 with sundry
essays by other authors, entitled <i>The Treasurie
of Ancient and Modern Times</i>. Considering that
London publishing was on a small scale two and
three centuries ago, it is difficult to believe that
Newton missed seeing these works, even if he
had not heard of the original. At anyrate, he
must in all probability have read what Shakspeare,
borrowing probably from the same source,
puts into the mouth of Cressida:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">But the strong base and building of my love</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Is as the very centre of the earth,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Drawing all things to it.</div>
<div class="attrib"><i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, act iv. scene 2.</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>Some anticipations of telegraphy are also very
interesting. Galileo, in his <i>Dialogues on the Two
Systems of the World</i>, that is, the Ptolemaic and
Copernican, and which he wrote in 1632, makes
Sagredo say: ‘You remind me of one who offered
to sell me a secret art, by which, through the
attraction of a certain magnet needle, it would be
possible to converse across a space of two or three
thousand miles. I said to him that I would
willingly become the purchaser, provided only
that I might first make a trial of the art, and
that it would be sufficient for the purpose if I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_738">{738}</span>were to place myself in one corner of the sofa
and he in the other. He replied that in so short
a distance the action would be scarcely discernible;
so I dismissed the fellow, and said that
it was not convenient for me just then to travel
into Egypt or Muscovy for the purpose of trying
the experiment; but that if he chose to go there
himself, I would remain in Venice and attend
to the rest.’</p>

<p>It appears, however, that telegraphy took form
as an idea two thousand years ago, for Addison,
in one of his delightful essays in the <i>Spectator</i>
(No. 241), tells us that ‘Strada, in one of his
Prolusions, gives an account of a chimerical
correspondence between two friends by the help
of a certain lodestone, which had such virtue in
it, that if it touched two several needles, when
one of the needles so touched began to move, the
other, though at never so great a distance, moved
at the same time, and in the same manner.
He tells us that the two friends, being each
of them possessed of one of these needles, made
a kind of a dial-plate, inscribing it with the
four-and-twenty letters, in the same manner as
the hours of the day are marked upon the ordinary
dial-plate. They then fixed one of the
needles on each of these plates in such a manner
that it could move round without impediment, so
as to touch any of the four-and-twenty letters.
Upon their separating from one another into
distant countries, they agreed to withdraw themselves
punctually into their closets at a certain
hour of the day and to converse with one another
by means of this their invention.’</p>

<p>In Homer’s <i>Odyssey</i>, translated by Pope, the
following curious description—originally detected
by an ingenious mechanic—of the Phœacian
ships of old, has been well observed by the late
Dr Birkbeck to be no inaccurate description of
steam-navigation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0">So shalt thou instant reach the realm assigned</div>
<div class="verse indent0">In wondrous ships, self-moved, instinct with mind.</div>
<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Though clouds and darkness veil the encumbered sky,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Fearless, through darkness and through clouds they fly;</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Though tempests rage—though rolls the swelling main,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">The seas may roll, the tempests swell in vain.</div>
<div class="verse indent0">E’en the stern god that o’er the waves presides,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Safe as they pass, and safe repass the tides,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">With fury burns; whilst careless they convey</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Promiscuous every guest to every bay.</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>It would almost appear from the above passage,
which for ages was considered merely a bold flight
of the imagination, that the ancients were not
unacquainted with some method beyond that of
the ordinary sail, of propelling vessels through
water with safety and celerity.</p>

<p>Even that horror of naval warfare, the fish-torpedo,
seems to have been once afloat in the
mind of Ben Jonson, although there are good
reasons for thinking he derived the idea itself
from Drummond the inventor, whom he visited
at Hawthornden in 1619. In Jonson’s play, <i>The
Staple of News</i> (act iii. scene 1), we read:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0"><i>Thomas.</i> They write here one Cornelius’ son</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Hath made the Hollanders an invisible eel</div>
<div class="verse indent0">To swim the Haven at Dunkirk, and sink all</div>
<div class="verse indent0">The shipping there.</div></div>

<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0"><i>Pennyboy.</i> But how is’t done?</div></div>

<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0"><i>Cymbal.</i> I’ll show you, sir.</div>
<div class="verse indent0">It’s an automa, runs under water</div>
<div class="verse indent0">With a snug nose, and has a nimble tail</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Made like an auger, with which tail she wriggles</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Betwixt the coats of a ship, and sinks it straight.</div></div>

<div class="stanza"><div class="verse indent0"><i>Pennyboy.</i> A most brave device</div>
<div class="verse indent0">To murder their flat bottoms!</div></div>
</div></div>

<p>Some of the most beneficent and useful discoveries
in medical science appear to have been
anticipated years ago. For example, certain
skulls of prehistoric man have afforded the
clearest evidence that even at that remote period
the art of <i>trepanning</i> must have been practised
upon them. A skull found in the tomb of the
Incas, near the city of Cuzco, exhibited distinct
marks of having undergone a like operation.
According to a reputed discovery by M. Stanislaus
Julien, it appears that as far back as the third
century of our era, the Chinese were in possession
of an anæsthetic agent which they employed
during surgical operations. A description of this
was discovered by M. Julien in a work preserved
in the Bibliothèque Nationale, called <i>Kou-kin-i-tong</i>,
or a General Collection of Ancient and
Modern Medicines, which appears to have been
published in the sixteenth century. In a biographical
notice of Hoa-tho, who flourished under
the dynasty of Wei, between the years 220 and
230 of our era, it is stated that he gave the patient
a preparation of <i>cannabis</i> (<i>Ma-yo</i>), who in a few
moments became as insensible as one plunged in
drunkenness or deprived of life; then, according
to the case, he made incisions, amputations, &amp;c.
After a certain number of days, the patient found
himself re-established, without having experienced
the slightest pain during the operation. It
appears from the biography of Han that this
<i>cannabis</i> was prepared by boiling and distillation.</p>

<p>Of the Germ Theory of disease, it must also be
said, it is no novelty. That noted physician,
Athanasius Kircher, in his work on the plague—published
at Rome in 1658—attributed the origin
of epidemics to germs, or, as he termed them,
animalcules. He argued that each kind of putrefaction
gives rise to a special virus, which produces
a definite species of malady.</p>

<p>Even sticking-plaster is not a modern surgical
appliance. One of the highest living authorities
in organic chemistry states that the ordinary
lead-plaster now so commonly used was said to
be discovered by the Roman physician Menecrates
in the middle of the first century.</p>

<p>Some readers of this <i>Journal</i> will remember
that while the British Association was in progress
at Montreal (1884), a telegram was received from
Mr Caldwell in Australia, notifying that he had
found <i>monotremes oviparous with mesoblastic ovum</i>—that
is, that the ornithorhynchus, the duck-bill
or water mole, laid eggs. This piece of news
greatly interested naturalists, since it was justly
regarded as furnishing one more link in the chain
of evidence tending to support the evolution
hypothesis. However, in a work entitled <i>The
Literary Pancratium</i>, by Robert and Thomas
Swinburn Carr, published in London in 1832,
a quotation in the form of a footnote appears on
page 8, as follows: ‘But this is New Holland,
where it is summer with us when it is winter in
Europe, and <i>vice versâ</i>; where the barometer rises
before bad weather, and falls before good; where
the north is the hot wind, and the south the
cold; where the humblest house is fitted up
with cedar; where the fields are fenced with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_739">{739}</span>mahogany, and myrtle-trees are burnt for firewood;
where the <i>swans are black</i> and the eagles
white; where the kangaroo, an animal between
the squirrel and the deer, has five claws on its
forepaws and three talons on its hind-legs, like a
bird, and yet hops on its tail; where the mole
lays eggs, and has a duck’s bill; where there is
a bird with a broom in its mouth instead of a
tongue; where there is a fish, one half belonging
to the genus <i>Raja</i>, and the other to that of
<i>Squalus</i>; where the pears are made of wood, with
the stalk at the broader end; and where the
cherry grows with the stone on the outside.’—(Field’s
<i>New South Wales</i>, page 461.)</p>

<p>In striking contrast to all the above-named
instances of rediscovery, is that fact furnished
by some Assyrian bas-reliefs—that is, that the
lion, or at least the Asiatic species, has a <i>claw</i>
in the tuft of his tail. This fact, which, strangely
enough, was disputed in classic times, although
forty years before the birth of Christ, Didymus of
Alexandria discovered it, had been quite overlooked
by modern naturalists. Soon after the
finding of the sculpture, Mr Bennett, an English
zoologist, verified the observation.</p>

<p>Homer’s famous story of the battle between
the frogs and the mice is doubtless a political
satire. That the story was originally suggested
by actual observation is not an unreasonable
fancy. Homer may even have seen the mimic
campaign for himself, for it is but a tradition
that he was blind. In a recent number of
<i>Nature</i>, a correspondent states that he saw a short
time since several mice pursuing some frogs in
a shed. The alacrity of the reptiles rendered
the attacks of the mice futile for some time.
‘Again and again the frogs escaped from the
clutches of their foes, but only to be recaptured,
severely shaken, and bitten.’ They were at length
‘overpowered by the mice, which devoured a
part of them.’</p>

<p>The first scientific expedition on record is one
in which Aristotle was sent by Alexander the
Great (more than 300 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) for the purpose of collecting
subjects for a History of Animals. In this
enterprise he met with both the paper and the
pearly nautilus; for in the <i>Historia Animalium</i>,
he says, after describing different forms of Cephalopods,
which no doubt abounded in Asiatic seas:
‘There are also two other kinds of polypes which
are in shells, the one [that is, the paper nautilus]
has a shell which is not naturally adherent to
it; it feeds very frequently near the land, and
being cast by the waves on the sand, the shell
slips, and it dies; but the other [the pearly
nautilus] is in a shell in which it exists after
the manner of a snail, and outwardly extends
its arms.’—(<i>Scaliger’s translation.</i>) Nothing was
added to this account during the dark ages that
succeeded, nor even till some time after the
revival of literature. No further information
respecting the nautilus was obtained until the
discovery of a living specimen early in the
eighteenth century by Rumphius, a Dutch merchant
and naturalist, resident at Amboyna. His
drawing of the soft parts separated from the
shell was greatly valued for more than a century
before another specimen was found, although the
shells were cast ashore in comparative abundance.
This specimen was sent to Professor Owen, and
formed the subject of an elaborate memoir by
him in 1832. It may be said to have been the
first to confirm the history of this remarkable
organism given more than two thousand years
before.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have another instance of modern
research simply verifying that which was an
ancient discovery.</p>

<p>It is even said that the stereoscope, which is
Professor Wheatstone’s invention, was known to
Euclid, and minutely described by Galen, the
physician, sixteen centuries ago; moreover, it was
still more completely defined in the works of
Baptista Porta in the year 1599. As for photography,
its discovery is by common consent
referred to Daguerre, who announced it to the
Academy of Sciences in 1839. This beautiful
art has, however, been found clearly described
by M. Jobard in his <i>Nouvelles Inventions aux
Expositions Universelles</i>, 1857, taken from a translation
from the German three hundred years
ago.</p>

<p>An ancient gold coin <i>recast</i> is, after all, the
same precious metal; even so, truths long lost
are, when found, restamped by human thought
and made current again for the world’s good.
How few are privileged, or have the genius, to
enrich mankind with an original discovery!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Le Gautier</span> followed the footman into the
drawing-room, where Enid was engaged with
some visitors—three tall showy-looking girls, with
an extremely vivacious mother. Le Gautier stood
looking out of one of the windows, and noticed
with satisfaction their intention of a speedy
exit. For some moments the visitors remained
chattering, and then, after a profusion of compliments,
accompanied by much laughter, their
voluminous skirts were heard switching down
the broad staircase. It has often been a matter
of speculation as to whether a man can be in
love with two women at the same time; but
without going into this delicate question, it
is possible to imagine a man with a penchant
for two women, though the experiment probably
would be attended with great hazard and danger.
Le Gautier forgot the dark-eyed Marie, as he
gazed upon Enid’s fairer charms.</p>

<p>‘You have heard nothing of Maxwell?’ he
asked after a pause in the desultory conversation.
‘A strange thing he does not write.
Many men would imagine that such a thing is
not altogether an accident; there are occasions
when a little absence from the gaze of man is
desirable, Miss Charteris.’</p>

<p>‘Many men, as usual, would be wrong,’ Enid
answered coldly. ‘You should not shield your
want of charity by these generalities, Monsieur
le Gautier, though perhaps you have derived
benefit from these absences yourself, you seem
to understand the subject so thoroughly.’</p>

<p>Enid was angry at his cool insolence, and
replied to his want of taste by a little plain
language herself; and her random shaft went
home.</p>

<p>‘You are severe; but really, while sorry for
Maxwell, there is something in it which is comforting
to me. Can you not guess what I mean?’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_740">{740}</span></p>
<p>Enid Charteris, though guileless and pure as
woman can be, had not mixed with the great
world for nothing. She had had suitors enough
to know what a proposal was, and above all
things she dreaded one from this man. Some
instinct told her he would be a dangerous enemy.
‘You speak in riddles,’ she said calmly. ‘I have
not been educated to the language of diplomacy.
Pray, explain yourself.’</p>

<p>‘Then I must be more explicit. Maxwell’s
absence rids me of a dangerous rival. Now he
is away, the path is all the smoother for me.
Need I tell you, Miss Charteris—Enid—that I
love you? Surely you must have known that
for a long time past. While another was in
the way, I sealed my lips; but I can restrain
myself no longer now.’</p>

<p>‘It would be affectation not to understand
you,’ Enid replied with a calmness that boded
ill for Le Gautier’s success. ‘I am sorry to hear
it. If you are wise, you will not put me to
the pain of a refusal.’</p>

<p>‘I will take no refusal,’ Le Gautier burst out
passionately; ‘for I swear that if you are not
mine, you shall wed no other man. Enid, you
must, you shall be mine! You may look upon
me coldly now, but the time will come when
you shall love me well enough.’</p>

<p>‘The time will come when I shall—love—you?’
The bitter scorn in these words stung
Le Gautier to madness, stirring up a desperate
passion in his veins, now that the prize seemed
like slipping from his grasp. He fell at her
feet on his knees. ‘Hear me!’ he exclaimed
passionately—‘only listen to me, Enid. I have
vowed that you are the only woman I have
chosen—the only girl I could really love. Such
love as mine must win a return some day; only
try; only give me a little chance of hope.’</p>

<p>‘If you are a man, you will rise from that
absurd position. Who am I, that you should
kneel to me? You must take my word for it;
and if you have any consideration for my feelings,
you will change the subject.’</p>

<p>‘And this is your absolute and final decision?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, it is my absolute and final decision.’</p>

<p>Le Gautier rose to his feet, pale but smiling,
and there was a darkly evil look upon his
white set face. When he spoke again his words
were cold and incisive. ‘Consider, before you
wilfully make an enemy of me.’ He uttered the
words with a low sibilation. ‘I have made you
an offer—the highest compliment I could pay,
and you have scornfully rejected it. The next
favour you ask from me you may seek for on
your knees.’</p>

<p>‘And to what purpose, sir, shall <i>I</i> ask a favour
from <i>you</i>?’</p>

<p>‘For your father,’ Le Gautier answered quietly,
though his tones were deep and earnest. ‘You
have guessed that Maxwell has gone away on a
dangerous mission. Why should not Sir Geoffrey
be chosen in his turn? And if so, who can save
him? I, Hector le Gautier, and no other man.’</p>

<p>‘And by whose evil counsel has my poor father
been dragged into your infamous Brotherhood?—By
yours alone! He would be a happy man
now, if he had never known you’——</p>

<p>‘On the contrary,’ Le Gautier interrupted, ‘I
tried to save him. He has joined on his own
wish. You do not credit my words. Go and
ask him now if my words are not true, and
that, if it is not his dearest wish that you should
become my wife.’</p>

<p>‘He might think so,’ Enid answered haughtily;
‘but he does not wish it in his heart. Monsieur
le Gautier, if you are a gentleman, you will cease
this discussion. The subject is painful to me.’
She stood there, looking at him coldly and scornfully.</p>

<p>But her very iciness only served to increase
the warmth of his passion. ‘I cannot!’ he exclaimed.
‘I will not cease! For five years,
ever since I first met you at Rome, I have never
ceased to love you. Bid me do anything in
reason; ask me any favour; but to forget you
is impossible!’</p>

<p>‘I am sorry for you,’ Enid said gently, touched
a little by the ring of genuine passion in his
voice—‘I am sorry; but it cannot be. I do not
break my pledges so lightly, even if I wished
to do so.’</p>

<p>‘Which you do not,’ Le Gautier bitterly remarked.
‘I do not care. I am desperate now.
You despise and scorn me; but I will not be
rejected thus. If you will not be my wife for
my sake, you must for your father’s and the
honour of your house.’ He stopped abruptly,
for standing in the room was Sir Geoffrey, his
face pale, and his whole aspect downcast and
degraded to a pitiable degree.</p>

<p>Enid turned to her father eagerly. ‘Did you
hear these words?’ she asked. ‘Can it be possible
that you—that I—that the honour of our
house is in any man’s hands? Can it be your
wish, father, that I—I—should form an alliance
with Monsieur le Gautier? Speak, and show
him how mistaken he can be!’</p>

<p>But Sir Geoffrey never spoke. His head sank
lower upon his breast. For the first time, he
realised the sacrifice he had imposed upon his
daughter, and so he stood there, an English
gentleman no longer, but a poor enfeebled,
shamefaced old man.</p>

<p>A wild feeling of alarm took possession of Enid
as she saw this thing. ‘Why do you not speak?’
she demanded. ‘What cause have you to hesitate
in indorsing my words?’</p>

<p>Still the baronet never spoke, never raised his
head.</p>

<p>Enid ran swiftly to his side and threw one
arm round his shoulder. She could feel the
spasm that struck him as he encountered her
touch. ‘Father,’ she asked in a dull even voice,
‘does your silence mean that he is right?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, my dear child; he is right. There is
no alternative.’</p>

<p>There is a providence which helps us in such
times as these, a numbness of the senses that for
a time deadens pain. Enid’s voice was very calm
as she turned to Le Gautier, standing there
trying to disguise his triumph. ‘I do not know
what all this means,’ she said. ‘I do not understand
whence you derive your power. I cannot
think now. For his sake,’ she continued, pointing
to her father, ‘I consent.’</p>

<p>Le Gautier sprang forward; but she repelled
him with a glance.</p>

<p>‘Listen to my conditions,’ she continued. ‘I
have said I consent; but I warn you that if
there is any loophole for escape from you, I shall
take it. You are going away, you say. Nothing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_741">{741}</span>must be done till your return, and then the contract
shall be fulfilled. Now, go.’</p>

<p>When Lucrece entered the room a few moments
later, she found her mistress lying unconscious
upon the floor. Looking out of the window,
she saw the slim figure of Le Gautier disappearing
in the distance, and smiled. He was smiling,
too, as he walked away. Nothing remained now
but only the final interview with Marie, and to
regain possession of the lost moidore. A few
weeks at Warsaw, and then——</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p>Maxwell had been gone a week now, and no
tidings of him had reached England, save one
letter to say he was in Rome. As Le Gautier
turned away from Grosvenor Square, his heart
one glow of triumph, he determined that, come
what may, the artist should never see England
again. When he returned from Warsaw, he
calculated that, through Marie St Jean’s assistance,
all information concerning the League
would be in the hands of the police, freeing
him from any further bondage, and throwing
all the odium and danger on her. Full of these
schemes, he arrived at his lodgings. A telegram
was lying on the table. He took it up mechanically,
and tore it open. The contents were terse:
‘Visci died this morning from heart disease.’
Le Gautier was wild with rage. Here was a
pretty combination, he thought. Nothing now
to detain Maxwell in Rome. The victim had
fallen by a higher Hand than that of man, and
Maxwell was free.</p>

<p>As a Head Centre of the Order, Le Gautier
wielded much power, and even now he did not
despair, with the command of nearly all the
desperadoes in Rome at his command. He had
only to get Maxwell arrested in Rome on some
false charge and carried to the mountains; and
there—after a little delay and a packed meeting
of the League—shot. Desperate men such as
Le Gautier, especially with such a prize in their
grasp, do not long hesitate over such a trifling
matter as a human life, and he trusted to his
own good luck and native audacity to pull him
through.</p>

<p>It was getting dark the same night as he
despatched a telegram to Rome, and then turned
in the direction of Fitzroy Square. He was as
eager now to see Isodore as he had been to
encounter Enid in the afternoon, and looked
forward not only to a pleasant evening but a
remunerative one.</p>

<p>She did not keep him long waiting in the
drawing-room ere she sailed in all smiles and
welcome. She was looking radiantly beautiful
to-night; there was a deeper flush on her face,
and a glitter in her glorious eyes not usually
seen there—signs of a loving welcome, Le Gautier
imagined in his egotistical way. There was,
besides, a warmth in her manner and a gladness
in the pressure of her hand which inspired him,
and sent an electric thrill coursing through his
veins.</p>

<p>‘You are looking more transcendently lovely
than usual, Marie!’ he exclaimed with a fervour
unusual even to him. ‘Every time I see you,
there is some additional charm in you to note.’</p>

<p>‘It depends upon whether the observing eye
is a prejudiced one,’ she replied with a caressing
smile, which brought him at once to her side.
‘You say that now, Hector. How long will you
continue to think so?’</p>

<p>‘As long as I have power to think at all—as
long as memory serves me. I shall remember
you to the last day of my life.’</p>

<p>‘I believe you will,’ Isodore smiled bewilderingly.
‘And yet, strange as it may seem, the
time will perhaps come when you will wish you
had never seen my face.’</p>

<p>‘You are more than usually enigmatical to-night,
Marie. You are a puzzle to me. I do
not even know who you are. Tell me something
about yourself, and why you are living in this
solitude here.’</p>

<p>‘No; not to-night; but, as I have often
promised you, I will tell you some time. I will
tell you who I am before you go away; and
then, when your curiosity is satisfied, you will
leave me.’</p>

<p>‘Never!’ Le Gautier exclaimed passionately.
‘Leave you!—the only woman I ever saw that
I could really love. Leave you, Marie! How
can you entertain the bare idea!’</p>

<p>He would have approached her nearer, but
she waved him gently but firmly aside. The
distance she kept him fanned his passion all the
more. ‘Tell me something about yourself,’ she
said. ‘That is a topic which never fails to
interest me. How about the League, this Maxwell’s
journey? Has he accomplished his mission
yet?’</p>

<p>‘He is not likely to, now. Visci is dead!—Gracious
powers, Marie! what ails you? Are
you ill?’</p>

<p>Isodore uttered a sharp exclamation, and then
reeled forward in her chair. Her face was white
and drawn, her lips trembled. Gradually her
bosom ceased to heave so painfully, and she
turned to Le Gautier with a white wan smile,
though he could see the fan still trembling in
her hands. ‘It is nothing,’ she said with an
effort. ‘I am subject to these attacks of the
heart, and any news of sudden death always
affects me so.—Do not look distressed; it is past
now.’</p>

<p>‘There is nothing in the name to cause you any
distress?’ Le Gautier asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>‘I have heard the name before, if that is what
you mean. Tell me all you know of this Carlo
Visci.’</p>

<p>‘I did not say his name was Carlo,’ Le Gautier
observed, somewhat sharply. ‘I can tell you
nothing more. When I reached home this afternoon,
I had a telegram to say he was dead.’</p>

<p>‘And this Maxwell, what of him? I suppose
he will return home now?’</p>

<p>‘He has been somewhat dilatory in obeying
orders. No; he will not return. He will be
detained at Rome for the present.’</p>

<p>‘Tell me why you hate this Englishman so.’</p>

<p>Le Gautier started. ‘How do you know I
hate him?’ he asked. ‘I have never said so.’</p>

<p>‘Not in so many words; but in gesture and
look, when you speak of him, your actions are
eloquent, my friend. He has crossed your path.
Ah, well, I like a good hater. Maxwell will
suffer yet.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ Le Gautier exclaimed involuntarily, ‘he
will.’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_742">{742}</span></p>
<p>Isodore rose and walked to the piano, where
she sat for a moment striking the chords idly.
‘When do you go to Warsaw?’ she asked.</p>

<p>‘I have six days remaining to me.—Marie, the
time has come when we must no longer delay.
The pear is ripe now; all my plans are matured.
I have only to hold up my hand and the League
will vanish.’</p>

<p>All this time, Isodore played on softly, musingly,
the music serving like the accompaniment
of a song to force the speaker’s voice. As he
stood there, and she answered him, she never
ceased to play the soft chords.</p>

<p>‘Then you have everything prepared?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, everything is ready.’ He drew a low
seat to her side, and seated himself there. ‘All
the names are made out, the whole plot prepared.’</p>

<p>‘And you propose to hand them over to me.
It is a great compliment; and I suppose I must
take them. I would run greater risks than this
for your sake and—my own.’</p>

<p>She took one hand from the ivory keys and
held it out to him. Drawing a packet from his
pocket, he gave it to her. She thrust it in her
bosom, and ran her fingers over the keys again.</p>

<p>‘All is there, I suppose,’ she asked, ‘down to
the minutest detail, everything necessary to
betray the League and pull it up root and
branch? You have taken good care to shield
yourself, I presume?’</p>

<p>‘Of course.—And now, to talk of more pleasant
things. You know I am going away in
a few days; and when I return, I shall expect
to find myself perfectly free.’</p>

<p>‘You may depend upon me. I will do all
I can for you.’</p>

<p>Le Gautier looked up sharply—the words were
coldly, sternly uttered, but the quiet placid smile
never left her face.</p>

<p>‘How strangely you speak! But oh, Marie—my
Marie, the only woman I ever loved, you
will stand by me now, and help me, for both
our sakes! Look at me, and say you will do
what I ask!’</p>

<p>Isodore looked down, smiling brightly. ‘Yes,
I will do what you ask,’ she said. ‘And so
you really love me?’</p>

<p>‘Passionately and sincerely, such as I never
expected to love woman yet.’</p>

<p>‘I am glad to hear you say that,’ Isodore
replied with a thrill of exultation in her voice.
‘I have waited and hoped for the time to come;
but never in my wildest dreams did I look for
this.’</p>

<p>‘With your nobleness and beauty, how could
it be otherwise? I should be more than a man—or
less—if I looked upon you unmoved.’</p>

<p>‘Then, for the first time for years, I am happy.’</p>

<p>Le Gautier started to his feet rapturously.
He did not understand her yet; he thought the
soft earnest words all for him. He would have
caught her there and then in his eager arms,
but again she repulsed him. ‘No, no!’ she cried;
‘I have not proved you yet. Let things remain
as they are till you return again to England.’</p>

<p>How strange, Le Gautier thought vaguely,
that she should use words so similar to those of
Enid to a precisely similar plea. Despite his
passion, he had not thrown all prudence to the
winds.</p>

<p>‘You had better leave me now,’ Isodore continued—‘leave
me to think and dwell over this
thing.’</p>

<p>‘But what about my badge of membership? I
dare not leave England without that.’</p>

<p>‘I had almost forgotten it in this interesting
conversation. It is not in my possession; it is
in Paris. You have a meeting of the League
before you go for final instructions. Come to
me after that, and you shall have it. I am going
to Paris to-morrow, and will bring it with me.’</p>

<p>‘You are a witch!’ Le Gautier exclaimed with
admiration. ‘You seem to know as much as the
mysterious Isodore, that princess who never shows
herself unless danger besets the League. If she
is the wonder men who have seen her say she is,
they stand in dire need of her now.’</p>

<p>‘Beware how you talk so lightly of her—she
has the gift of fernseed. At this very moment
she may know of your perfidy.’</p>

<p>‘Perfidy is a hard word, my queen, and sounds
not prettily.—And now, good-night. And you
will not fail me?’</p>

<p>‘I will <i>not</i> fail you,’ Isodore replied with the
stern inflection Le Gautier had noticed before,
and marvelled over. ‘I never fail.’</p>

<p>‘A woman, and never fail!’</p>

<p>‘Not in my promises. If I make a vow or
pledge my word, I can wait five years or ten to
fulfil it.—Good-night. And when we meet again,
you will not say I have belied my contract.’</p>

<p>When Valerie entered some minutes later, she
found Isodore with firm-set face and gleaming
eyes. ‘My brother is dead,’ she said quietly.
‘Poor Carlo! And he loved me so at one time.
Now, he can never know.’</p>

<p>‘Dead!’ Valerie exclaimed. ‘You do not mean
to say’——</p>

<p>‘That Maxwell killed him?—No. His heart
has been failing for years, long before I left
Rome; his life was not worth an hour’s purchase.
But I have no time to mourn over him
now.—Let me see if I can do a little good with
my useless occupation. I start for Rome to-morrow.’</p>

<p>Valerie looked at her friend in stupid astonishment.</p>

<p>‘I cannot explain to you now. Maxwell is
free to return home. As you know, it means
destruction to Le Gautier’s plans, if he does.
I dared not press him too closely to-night;
but Maxwell will be detained in Rome, in all
probability by Paulo Lucci, till some charge can
be trumped up for his destruction. But Lucci
and his band dare not cross me; my power is
too great for that. To-morrow, I leave for Rome,
and pray heaven that I may not be too late!’</p>




<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop"><div class="chapter"><h2 class="nobreak" id="AMERICAN_TRAITS">AMERICAN TRAITS.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is usual in this country to regard the Americans
as a homogeneous people, and to accept the
Yankee as a fair type of the whole nation. But
this is a fallacy. The inhabitants of the South,
and more especially the descendants of the early
French and Spanish colonists to be found in
the Gulf States, differ radically in their morals,
manners, and customs from the population of
other sections of the Union. It is not, however,
our purpose in this paper to enter into an
extended disquisition upon the characteristics
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_743">{743}</span>of the people of the United States, our object
being simply to touch briefly upon a few of
their more prominent traits. The Puritan element
in the character of the first settlers of New
England has exercised an influence upon social
life there which has not been confined to that
limited area, but has made itself felt, in a more
or less marked degree, throughout the whole of
the Northern States. The differences of race
and climate have, however, not only been obstacles
to the inhabitants of the South accepting the
Puritan standard of morals, but have also prevented
the development of those traits of character
to be found in the population of other parts of
the country, and which are more peculiarly distinctive
of the Americans as a people. We shall
therefore limit ourselves to dealing with those
national characteristics which have come under
our observation in the Northern States.</p>

<p>That submission to the will of the majority
which is inculcated by democratic institutions has
exercised a marked influence upon the social no
less than upon the political life of the people of
the United States, save in the late Slave States.
It has not only had the result of preventing the
development of individuality of character, but
likewise has considerably modified that obstinacy
of temper and dogged tenacity of opinion which
are to be found in the Anglo-Saxon race. The
late Lord Beaconsfield on one occasion said in the
House of Commons that a gentleman who had
spent several years in America had declared to
him that it was his belief that ‘the citizens of
the republic were the most tractable people in
the world, and the readiest open to conviction
by argument.’</p>

<p>In the United States, the absence of that segregation
of the various grades of society which exist
in Europe is evinced by the habits and manners
of the masses in that country. If the national
independence of character be occasionally pushed
too far, and degenerate into offensive self-assertion,
at least it prevents any approach to servility. No
inequality of position or circumstances will induce
a native of any of the Northern States to submit
to being dealt with in the manner or spoken to
in the tone which, in England, the man in broadcloth
too frequently adopts, as a matter of course,
towards the man in fustian. The late Sydney
Godolphin Osborne used to relate how, once, a
respectable artisan said to him: ‘I like you, my
lord; there is nothing of the gentleman about
you.’ The meaning of the speaker was undoubtedly
that Lord Osborne did not treat him
in the patronising manner that members of the
higher class usually address those whom they
regard as their social inferiors. Now, no one perhaps
has a keener appreciation of the advantages
of wealth and education than the American;
but that the possessor of them should feel himself
justified in using towards the man who lacks these
adventitious gifts the language of a superior to
an inferior, is what he cannot understand, and
which he will not for one moment put up with.
An anecdote Thackeray used to relate of an
experience of his when in the United States
well illustrates this trait of the people. While
in New York, he expressed to a friend a desire to
see some of the ‘Bowery Bhoys,’ who, he had
heard, were a class of the community peculiar to
that city. So one evening he was taken to the
Bowery, and he was shown a ‘Bhoy.’ The young
man, the business of the day being over, had
changed his attire. He wore a dress-coat, black
trousers, and a satin waistcoat; whilst a tall
hat rested on the back of his head, which was
adorned with long well-greased hair—known as
‘soap-locks’—a style which the rowdies of that
day affected. The youth was leaning against a
lamp-post, smoking an enormous cigar; and his
whole aspect was one of ineffable self-satisfaction.
The eminent novelist, after contemplating him
for a few moments with silent admiration,
said to the gentleman by whom he was accompanied:
‘This is a great and gorgeous creature!’
adding: ‘Can I speak to him without his taking
offence?’</p>

<p>Receiving an answer in the affirmative, Thackeray
went up to the fellow, on the pretext of
asking his way, and said: ‘My good man, I want
to go to Broome Street.’</p>

<p>But the unlucky phrase, ‘My good man,’
roused the gall of the individual spoken to.
Instead, therefore, of affording the information
sought, the ‘Bhoy’—a diminutive specimen of
humanity, scarcely over five feet in height—eyeing
the tall form of his interlocutor askance,
answered the query in the sense that his permission
had been asked for the speaker to visit
the locality in question, and he said, patronisingly:
‘Well, sonny, yer kin go thar.’</p>

<p>When Thackeray subsequently related the incident,
he laughingly declared that he was so disconcerted
by the unexpected response, that he
had not the courage to continue the dialogue.</p>

<p>The question, however, differently put would,
in all probability, have elicited a civil answer
from ninety-nine out of a hundred of the members
of the class to which the man belonged. In fact,
the discourtesy, and even rudeness, of which some
travellers in the United States complain have
arisen from the fact of their failing to appreciate
the difference existing between the social systems
of that country and their own.</p>

<p>The wide gulf in culture which in England
separates the upper and middle classes from the
lower orders, does not exist in America. This
has arisen from various causes. In the first
place, the great bulk of the people of the Union
are much better educated than is as yet the
case in this country. The admirable system of
common or, as they are termed, ‘public’ schools
which prevails in America affords facilities for
all children obtaining a sound English education
without the payment by their parents of any
school fees, and at a trifling cost to the taxpayer
in all sections of the Union, and especially in the
West, where large grants have been made of the
State lands in support of the public schools. In
the second place, the social status of the working
classes who are <i>natives</i> of the United States has
been raised by the fact that the Americans are
almost exclusively engaged in avocations demanding
intelligence and skilled labour. This has
been owing to the circumstance that upon the
coloured population and the Irish and German
immigrants have devolved those coarse and irksome
occupations which have to be followed by
a portion of the inhabitants of other countries.
To give one instance of this alone, it may be
stated that rarely is a native American citizen,
man or woman, found occupying the position
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_744">{744}</span>of a domestic servant in any of the Atlantic
cities.</p>

<p>The wages, too, commanded by artisans and
mechanics averaging nearly double those of the
same class in other countries, it follows, necessarily,
that vice and crime—the inevitable concomitants
of a state of society in which the
condition of the mass of the lower classes is but
one step removed from absolute indigence, as is
the case in most European countries—are not
nearly so prevalent in America. In the New
England States, where the foreign population is
small, there is not a country in Europe—possibly
with the exception of Holland—where there is
so little crime. Few persons, indeed, are aware
how much the foreign element in the community,
in many of the States, contributes to the statistics
of the offences which come under the cognisance
of the criminal tribunals. In the State of New
York alone, seventy per cent. of the infractions
of the law are committed by the Irish, whilst
the fair ratio of this class in proportion to the
whole population would be a little less than
twenty per cent.</p>

<p>One of the most marked characteristics of the
Americans is their rooted determination to resist
any legislation which shall recognise any class
distinctions in the community. Of course, no one
contends that the man of wealth, education, and
culture is not the superior, in one sense of the
word, of him who lacks these. The equality
insisted upon is simply this: that no class of
society shall make the circumstance of enjoying
these adventitious advantages a ground for the
members of it basing a claim to be a separate
caste, possessing rights and privileges—fenced in
by law—denied to the bulk of their countrymen.
This sentiment found expression in the opposition
which the proposal met with, a few years ago,
that persons in the Civil Service of the Federal
government should be irremovable, save for misconduct,
instead of being turned out of their places
after every change of administration, as had previously
been the case. It was argued that fixity
of tenure of office would have the result of
creating a bureaucracy, the members of which
would come in time to regard themselves as a
privileged class. That these apprehensions were
unfounded, experience of the practical working of
the new system of government patronage has
proved. But the very fact of the objection having
been raised at all shows how sensitive public
opinion was on the subject.</p>

<p>One noticeable feature of American society is
that in none of the Northern States does an officer
in the army or navy enjoy the social status that he
commands in all European countries. Holmes, in
<i>The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table</i>, has commented
upon this trait of his countrymen. He says: ‘It
is curious to observe of how small account military
folk are held among our Northern people. Our
young men must gild their spurs, but they need
not win them. The equal division of property
keeps the younger sons of rich people above the
necessity of military service. Thus, the army
loses one element of refinement, and the moneyed
upper classes forget what it is to count heroism
amongst their virtues. Still, I don’t believe in
any aristocracy without pluck as its backbone.
Ours may show it when the day comes, if ever it
does come.’</p>

<p>The opportunity for young men of the wealthier
class proving their manhood came sooner than
Holmes anticipated when he penned the above
remarks; for less than three years later, the
civil war broke out, and then this class were not
slack in responding to the call of their country
for their services. Numerous instances occurred
of young men reared in luxury—unable to
obtain commissions owing to their want of military
training—shouldering muskets in the ranks
of the Federal armies; and their patriotism received
due recognition from their fellow-citizens.
But in time of peace it is the members of the community
who are engaged in those pursuits best
remunerated who are held in the highest estimation—a
necessary result of a condition of society
in which wealth is the standard by which social
position is measured and defined. The girl who
in the French song exclaims, ‘Oh! que j’aime les
militaires!’ utters a sentiment which as a rule
finds no echo in the hearts of the American fair.
An odd illustration of this fact came under the
observation of the writer when he was resident in
New York. A lady—whose brother had been
educated at the government Military Academy
at West Point—gave, in all seriousness, the reason
why this gentleman, after graduating, had not
accepted a commission in the army, in these
words: ‘He had a higher ambition than to be a
mere soldier, so he has become a dry-goods
merchant.’</p>

<p>In New York, and indeed in all the larger
Atlantic cities, a class has sprung up of late years
which affects to look down upon the political and
social institutions of their country. Mr Howells,
in his novel <i>A Woman’s Reason</i>, speaking of one
of the Upper Ten, says: ‘He saw what a humbug
democracy and equality really were. He must
have seen that nobody practically believes in
them.’ This sentiment may accurately reflect
the opinions of a limited class, but it is an absolute
fallacy to assert that such views are generally
entertained. On the contrary, they have not to
any appreciable extent permeated the people at
large, and there is not the slightest likelihood of
their affecting the national life or changing its
standards.</p>

<p>In closing these desultory observations upon
some of the characteristic traits of the Americans,
the writer may state that they are based upon
personal observation during a residence of several
years in the United States.</p>

<h3 title="CHAP. I.">IN TWO CHAPTERS.—CHAP. I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Nicholas Smethby</span> lived, in pretty easy
circumstances, at a town some thirty or forty
miles distant from London, from which metropolis
he had retired on leaving off business.
His profession had been, nominally, that of an
accountant; but he had seldom troubled himself
greatly about accounts, and had not received
many commissions to investigate them. He had
really been a speculator in stocks and shares, in
a small but profitable way; and while he lent
but little of his own money in loans, had made
a great deal of profit as agent, or ‘middleman,’
between those who wished to borrow and those
who were able to lend. So Mr Smethby had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_745">{745}</span>lived in a circle in which it was necessary for
him to have his wits about him, and in which
a somewhat decided hankering for gain was likely
to be developed; yet in this he was perhaps no
worse than most of his neighbours; while, ’cute
as he was, he was not a bad sort of fellow, take
him altogether. He was pleasant and social
enough in his family circle, a pretty large one,
but reduced, as far as his own household was
concerned, to one daughter, Harriet, the other
members having married. Two of these had
settled in the neighbourhood of Valeborough, the
town referred to; while Mr Smethby had long
been a widower. He had no other relations, that
he knew of, and, as he was wont to say when
speaking on the subject, he did not want to hear
of any. His cousin, George Styles, was the last
he had had much to do with, and, ah!—Mr
Smethby would exclaim at such times as the
subject was brought up—he did not care about
any more like him.</p>

<p>‘Twenty years ago, sir,’ he would explain, ‘he
called on me with a cock-and-bull story of his
being in trouble and wanting to get to Australia;
and I was fool enough to lend him twenty pounds.
Yes, sir, lent twenty pounds to a man I did not
care two straws for, and had seen barely a dozen
times in my life. What was the consequence?
Why, I never heard any more of him or my
twenty pounds either, and don’t know to this
day whether he went to Australia or not. I
should decidedly say <i>not</i>. That is all I know
about my relations.’</p>

<p>It must be owned that it was at the best a
selfish kind of cheerfulness, which was derived
from the belief that he had no kith or kin out
of his own household; but Smethby was rather
a selfish man. He certainly was too fond of
talking in this strain.</p>

<p>It happened that, towards the close of a bright
June day, Mr Smethby was at a railway station
some two or three miles from his residence. To
aid in identifying the town, we may say that
there was another line which ran through or
at least close to it; but from the station in question,
an omnibus plied to Valeborough, and it
was for this vehicle that Mr Smethby waited on
the little platform.</p>

<p>‘We shall have a wet night, I expect,’ said a
voice in his ear.</p>

<p>He looked round, and saw a sailor-like man,
whom he had already noticed, and who was
scanning the horizon in a sailor-like manner.
Mr Smethby made a fitting reply to this remark,
and a desultory conversation ensued. The expected
omnibus now coming into sight as it
crossed a rise in the road at some distance,
Smethby instinctively shifted his valise a little
nearer to the gate. The man good-naturedly
helped him, as he was close to the bag, and
exclaimed, as he saw the label upon it: ‘Smethby!
It is odd that I should see that name to-day, for
it is not a common one.’</p>

<p>‘I do not think it is often met with,’ said Mr
Smethby. ‘But what is there odd in your seeing
it to-day?’</p>

<p>‘Well, perhaps not much,’ replied the man,
with a smile; ‘but I was talking about that
name a good deal yesterday, and for weeks before.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed! May I ask how that was?’ said his
listener.</p>

<p>‘I have just come from Australia,’ returned
the sailor. (Mr Smethby could not help growing
suddenly attentive at this.) ‘I landed yesterday
at Gravesend, and bade good-bye to an old chum.
Ah! he was a good chum too! Five years had
I worked in the next claim to old George, as we
called him. His right name was George Styles.’</p>

<p>‘George Styles!’ exclaimed Mr Smethby.—‘But
I must apologise for interrupting you.’</p>

<p>‘He had done well—better than any of us,’
continued the sailor. ‘Some folks said he was
worth a quarter of a million of money; but I
never believed that; about half the figure would
be nigher. He said he had no friends in England
he cared for now, except one Mr Smethby. That
is why the name startled me. He was always
talking about him. It was on purpose to see
him he went on to London with the ship; he
lives somewhere in the City.’</p>

<p>‘O—h!’ said Mr Smethby. This was a long-sustained
syllable, the gentleman having a curiously
complicated rush of thought just then.</p>

<p>‘Yes, he lives in London; and I think old
George means playing a rare trick on him,’ said
the sailor, whose smile broke into a laugh here.
‘He used to say what a game it would be to go
and pretend he was poor and broken down, so
as to see who were his real friends and who were
not. It is my belief he will do it too; and when
I go back to London, I’ll try to find him out,
to hear all about it. Ha, ha, ha!’</p>

<p>The omnibus drew up at this moment; and
the sailor, knowing their conference must end,
touched his cap and drew back.</p>

<p>‘A—was this George Styles really so rich?
I ask, because your story has interested me,’
said Mr Smethby hurriedly. ‘He must be a
droll fellow!’</p>

<p>‘Rich! Why, I’ve seen with my own eyes
the banker’s receipts for the best part of a ton
of gold of his, first and last,’ returned the sailor;
‘and that was only a part of his luck. His last
words to me were: “Bill”—my name is Bill
Brown—“Bill, as long as I live, you shall never
want a friend.” Nor I shan’t, I know.—Good-day,
sir.’</p>

<p>Mr Smethby entered the vehicle, and had a
silent, thoughtful ride to Valeborough. The
sailor’s conversation, helter-skelter and rattle-brain
as it was, had furnished him with much
food for thought; and finding that his son was
at his house, when he arrived there—this son
was married and settled at Valeborough—he immediately
took him, with Miss Harriet, into
council. During his narrative, repeated exclamations
of astonishment broke from his hearers.</p>

<p>‘Why, father,’ cried his daughter as he finished,
‘this must be your cousin George; and you are
the Mr Smethby he is looking for.’</p>

<p>‘Of course I am; I saw that at once,’ replied
her father.</p>

<p>‘But what is to be done?’ asked Mr Joe, the
son. ‘You have left London for years; he may
be looking about for you till doomsday, and be
no nearer finding you.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose he will go to my old address. The
people there know where I am, and will send
him down,’ said Mr Smethby. ‘I expect that
is how it will be.’</p>

<p>‘I hope so, I am sure,’ continued his son;
‘otherwise, we may lose a splendid chance.’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_746">{746}</span></p>
<p>Smethby could not help admitting the possibility
of this, which seemed to disturb him a
good deal, yet nothing could be done to avert it.</p>

<p>‘We must be careful to show him every kindness,’
said Harriet. ‘After having been away from
England so long, he will feel pleased at’——</p>

<p>‘Leave me alone,’ interposed Smethby, with
a nod and a wink, which meant much. ‘I flatter
myself I can see my way here pretty clearly. I
only hope he comes, that is all.’</p>

<p>Mr Smethby would have written to his successors
in London, asking them to give his address
to any inquirer; but he abstained, partly because
he felt sure they would do this in any case, but
chiefly from the danger that his request might
be mentioned to his cousin, and so show that he,
Mr Smethby, had a knowledge of his arrival in
England.</p>

<p>No days in the lives of Mr Smethby and his
family had ever appeared so long as each of the
next two or three which followed their little
family interview. The suspense was—as the
elder gentleman pronounced it to be—‘excruciating;’
but it came to an end in time.</p>

<p>Mr Smethby was in his front-garden in the
afternoon, trying to occupy himself; but his mind
was busy on a subject very different from botany,
when, happening to look up from his flower-beds,
he met the eyes of a man who was watching him
over the fence, as this man stood on the footpath.
He smiled when he met the glance of Smethby,
who actually recoiled in his astonishment; for
although he had been thinking without cessation
of his cousin, yet it was like an electric shock in
its suddenness to look round and find the very
man face to face with him; for this was, must
be, he felt, George Styles. He did not know him,
had no recollection of his features; but the
bronzed, bushy-whiskered, bushy-bearded man,
dressed something like a sailor, yet not to be
mistaken for one, who smiled at him across
the garden fence, was his cousin, there could be
no doubt of that.</p>

<p>‘Well, Nick, old fellow!’ began the stranger;
‘I see you know me, although it is many years
since we parted.’</p>

<p>‘Why, it is George Styles!’ exclaimed Mr
Smethby, with an assumption of surprise and
‘gush’ which did him infinite credit, and of
which he felt secretly proud for a good while.
He seized the other’s hand and wrung it over
the fence with a prolonged heartiness, as though
he could not bear to relinquish it. ‘My dear
old boy, how glad I am to see you!’ he resumed,
as soon, it appeared, as his feelings would allow
him to speak. ‘Come in. How did you find
me out? But never mind that now. Come in!
I shall have a thousand things to talk about.—This
is Harriet; the only unmarried one now;
she was in arms when you went away, so I don’t
expect you to remember her.—Now, Harriet, let
us have a cup of tea; and put the best we have
in the house on the table to-day, if we never
do so again.’</p>

<p>‘You are almost too kind, Nick,’ said the other,
and there was really a little catch in his voice as
he spoke. ‘I did not expect—indeed, I don’t
deserve such generosity. I think I had first
better run down to the <i>Railway Tap</i> and bespeak
my room there, for I hope to stay three or four
days at Valeborough.’</p>

<p>‘Three or four days!’ exclaimed Mr Smethby;
‘bespeak a room at the <i>Railway Tap</i>! I don’t
mean to part with you, now I have found you
again, under three or four months; and if you
do not make this your home for everything, I—I—I’ll
never forgive you.’</p>

<p>Miss Harriet, in an equally gratifying strain,
indorsed these sentiments, at which Styles was
evidently affected.</p>

<p>‘I did not expect—could not have hoped for
this,’ he returned; ‘and seeing that I have returned
a—a poor man’—the awkward stop he
made, ere he could get this out, amused Smethby—‘it
is so kind of you. If it will not cause any
inconvenience, I will stay here a little while,
and I will do anything I can to repay your
generosity’——</p>

<p>Here he was interrupted by the good-tempered
laughter which such an idea excited, and the
evening passed off merrily.</p>

<p>Mr Joe and his wife looked in—by chance, as
they explained; as did Mr Brooks and his wife—formerly
Miss Susy Smethby—who came also by
chance; the result being that there was quite a
jovial party, and that Mr Styles received the
warmest invitations to become a frequent visitor
at the house of Mr Joe and at that of Mr
Brooks.</p>

<p>After this night, too, there was unwonted pleasantry
at Mr Smethby’s, for not only his family
but some of the neighbours were constantly
dropping in, and it was wonderful what an interest
they all took in the gentleman from Australia.
The latter was very guarded—kept up his character
well, did him great credit, Mr Joe said.
But no one can avoid an occasional flaw, and one
or two were detected even in him. He was wont
to deplore the hardships which unsuccessful men
suffered in a colony—in fact, he did not like to
enter on any detail of his painful experiences—never
would do so.</p>

<p>‘Your hardships do not seem greatly to have
injured you, George,’ his host would answer;
‘you look a good ten years younger than your age;
and many a man who has never been fifty miles
from London shows the wear and tear of toil and
worry, of which you complain so much, more
than you do.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! but it is the future!’ Mr Styles would
say, when such a debate arose—he would say it
with a sad shake of the head—‘it is the future
which preys on my mind, what I am to do for
the rest of my life.’</p>

<p>It was difficult for Mr Smethby, knowing so
much as he did, to listen gravely to such arguments
as these; but he was grave, and his manner
encouraged Styles to confide in him—after a
fashion.</p>

<p>He soon showed an interest in speaking of certain
Australian investments which it appeared
some friend of his thought highly of; a shallow
ruse, not likely to deceive such a man as his
cousin. Styles further mentioned that a gold-miner
whom he knew had put ten thousand
pounds into one of these specs less than two years
before, and he could now sell out for thirty thousand
any day he chose; but he was too good a
judge to do that, as in another two years the
present value would be doubled, and then,
perhaps, he might be tempted to realise. This
same miner, as he had heard, held five or six
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_747">{747}</span>other investments, nearly all as good, and was in
expectation of hearing news which would enable
him to employ the other half of his capital,
which was now lying idle—only making a paltry
three per cent.—quite as well. All this Mr
Styles had heard from his friend.</p>

<p>All this amused Smethby, who read his visitor
the more thoroughly in proportion as the latter
sought to envelop himself in these far-fetched
disguises. No additional proof was needed to
satisfy Smethby; but the evidence was in a
manner forced upon him to expose most completely
the absurd trick which his cousin was
attempting to play off upon him.</p>

<p>Harriet found a letter on the floor of their
visitor’s room: it would have been expecting too
much from the feminine, or perhaps from any
temperament, to suppose she would not read it.
Its contents were so interesting, although exceedingly
brief, that she showed the note to her father.
It was from a firm in London, a stockbroker’s
evidently, referring to some inquiry from ‘George
Styles, Esq.’ as to the purchase of shares to the
amount of twenty thousand pounds, in the Bodgamaree
mines—the very speculation that Smethby
had heard his cousin refer to in their last conversation
as being in great favour with the
unnamed gold-miner! The shares were low at
present, the letter said, and could be bought at
about eighty per cent., so that a little over sixteen
thousand pounds would be sufficient.</p>

<p>‘That settles it, then,’ said Smethby. ‘Be sure
to put the letter back where you found it, Harriet;
and mind what I told you the other day. Play
your cards properly, and I am sure you will
win.’</p>

<p>This utterance was rather obscure; but his
daughter understood it well enough to induce her
to pout and frown a little, and to move with what
is generally described as a ‘flounce.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! it is all very well,’ said the gentleman;
‘but you ought to know better than to dream of
allowing a quarter of a million of money to go
out of the family.—Who is Robert Crewe, I should
like to know?’</p>

<p>This speech would have been, to a third party,
equally obscure with that which had gone before;
but as we do not wish to have any mystery, we
may explain that, almost from the first, Cousin
George had appeared much impressed by Harriet’s
good looks, and had shown her attentions which
gradually became more marked. He was five-and-twenty
years older than the girl, it was true;
but as he had himself said to Smethby, a man
ought to be a good deal older than a woman,
when they marry; and when a man had been
abroad, knocking about the world best part of
his time, he then knew what a home was, and
felt the want of a young and cheerful wife.</p>

<p>All this Smethby had pointed out to his
daughter before; but was shocked to find—for
he really considered her a sensible, clear-headed
girl, as a rule—that a ridiculous friendship with
one Robert Crewe, a doctor’s assistant in the
town, blocked the way of this new road to
wealth and position.</p>

<p>Robert Crewe! Smethby had not ordinary
patience with the idea. He admitted that he
had known of, and in some sort of way approved,
or, rather, had not forbidden this intimacy—it
was in this roundabout manner he now described
his conduct—and the young fellow, in his place,
might be well enough; but to compare him and
his miserable gallipot and sticking-plaster prospects,
with George Styles, was enough to put any
man out of temper. Robert Crewe, forsooth!</p>

<p>Yet, with all this natural indignation and in
spite of this sarcasm, Miss Harriet could not
quite make up her mind to renounce the young
doctor; but it might come in time.</p>

<p>That very night—after the discovery of the
letter, we mean—Mr Styles on his return broached
two subjects which were strongly suggestive,
especially when his hearers were behind the
scenes to a degree he did not suspect. These
hearers were only Mr Smethby and his daughter.
It was a quiet night, such as delighted Mr Styles;
he really appeared to enjoy himself pretty well
under all conditions; but he declared this evening
that a snug little family chat was sweeter
than anything else, to an old wanderer like himself.
Port, sherry, and claret were at hand; for
while Smethby was, as a rule, strictly economical,
so that wine rarely appeared at his table, his
hospitality to his cousin led him into a freer
display of such luxuries now, than of old. But
the taste of Mr Styles was simple—old-fashioned,
he said; and he drank scarcely anything but
cold brandy-and-water, to which he was remarkably
partial. It was over a glass of this innocent
beverage—always mixed half and half, at which,
even in his bloom of hospitality, Mr Smethby
winced—that he spoke of the subjects indicated.
He referred to a friend of his—it was odd how
satisfied he seemed with this shallow artifice, and
how often he resorted to it—who was about to
buy a small property near London. This property
was at Richmond—only a mere toy, a little villa,
with coachhouse and stables; a pretty conservatory,
with a couple of acres of land—that was
all. It was freehold—his friend would have
nothing else—and it commanded the prettiest
view on the river.</p>

<p>Now, what was Miss Harriet’s opinion? Did
she prefer living in the country outright, or near
London? What did she think of his friend’s
choice? Harriet hesitated, and her colour went
and came; but Smethby spoke up for her, and
said that, like every other young girl, she would
prefer living near the great metropolis, with its
theatres, its balls, its parks and the like.—O
yes! of course. Harriet but feebly echoed this
opinion, which was repeated and enlarged on by
Smethby.</p>

<p>Later in the evening, when the elders were
alone, Styles brought up his friend again; it
was, as before, in reference to an investment,
and Mr George said how he wished his cousin
had a little money to spare, as he knew—his
friend knew, that was—of a chance for doubling
and trebling every penny invested.</p>

<p>Smethby, with his usual good-tempered laugh—he
was always good-tempered, when with
Styles—said that for all George knew he might
have a trifle by him. On hearing this, his cousin
expressed his pleasure, and said that his friend
was going to invest nearly twenty thousand
pounds in the spec. Such figures were beyond
Smethby, as that gentleman owned; but one,
or even two thousand, he might command. In
short, ere they parted that night, he had resolved
to remove his cash from his deposit account at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_748">{748}</span>the town bank and join this friend in his speculation.</p>

<p>Styles was pleased to hear this; and when
Smethby said he should like to see his friend,
laughed, and confusedly said he would tell his
cousin more about him soon.</p>




<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop"><div class="chapter"><h2 class="nobreak" id="ECONOMY_OF_FUEL">ECONOMY OF FUEL.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr Hull</span>, a celebrated geologist, has calculated
that there is still a quantity of coal in store in
England and Wales sufficient to afford a supply
of one hundred and twenty millions of tons for
about five hundred years. This would be a
cheerful estimate, if we could cordially and
unquestioningly accept it. But, unfortunately,
we cannot, other competent observers having
affirmed that the coal deposits of this country
will be exhausted in less than two hundred years.
We would, therefore, urge with all earnestness,
that the people and the government should pay
more especial attention to this vital subject than
they have hitherto done.</p>

<p>Of course, there are two chief points on which
any interference could be effectual: these are,
the exportation of coal, and the wasteful processes
of mining now in vogue. The former of
these involves the great question of free-trade,
and the right of each coal-proprietor to sell the
produce of his land and labour at the best possible
price. The latter is even a still more difficult
thing to meddle with, and must, perhaps,
be met rather by the provisions made on the
part of landed proprietors, when leasing their
subterranean property to practical miners, than
by anything government can do. At present,
the proprietor, having a life-interest in his estate,
desires to obtain from the mines the largest
amount of the most valuable coal at the smallest
working loss. The result is, that vast quantities
of inferior but yet valuable material are left in
the pits; quantities that would do something
towards meeting the growing consumption in
this kingdom.</p>

<p>Selfish, narrow-minded people might exclaim:
‘Oh! there will be quite enough of coal to last
us our time. We don’t expect or want to live
for ever; therefore, we won’t bother ourselves
about the economy of fuel.’</p>

<p>Let us remind such unpatriotic mortals that
our manufacturing and commercial interests rest
upon our supplies of coal as their foundation-stone.
Our commercial rivals across the Atlantic
possess magnificent coal-fields, that are practically
of indefinite extent. Exhaust <i>our</i> coal-fields,
and their supremacy will become complete.
It behoves each and every one of us to
think of the future of our country and of the
interests of those who come after us.</p>

<p>Perchance some cynic may say: ‘What has
posterity ever done for me? Let posterity take
care of itself.’</p>

<p>‘Very well,’ we reply; ‘let posterity do for
itself. Let us only be influenced by selfish and
non-altruistic principles, and think only of ourselves.
The question is, how can we put money
into our own pockets by using less coal than
we do?’</p>

<p>First, we can do so by using proper grates.
Down to the time of Count Rumford, the modern
world of coal-burners never thought of the true
theory of caloric in connection with grates.
Burners of wood had not tried to be economical;
they did not expect to be warm on more than
one side. When their bodies were scorched and
their eyes smarted, they had what they bargained
for. Rumford appeared as a new teacher; he
laid down the principles of heat and combustion
with admirable clearness, and flooded England
with grates of his favourite type. But in spite
of the teachings of the Count, coal-fires of to-day
are as dirty, chilly, and as wasteful as ever.</p>

<p>The waste of coal in Britain is positively disgraceful.
One hundred and twenty millions of
tons are consumed every year. Of this, one half
might be saved by the adoption of improved
appliances. About thirty million pounds sterling
might thus be kept in our banks, instead of
being turned into cinders and smoke. The pall
of smoke and fog that broods over London contains
in a single day fifty tons of coal! The
fact is that we burn coal in house-fires on an
entirely false principle—that is, on the principle
of a blast-furnace, letting cold air pass through
the centre of the fire, to blaze the coal rapidly
away, and hurry the heat and half-burnt gases
unused up the chimney. We have to go back
to the good old principle of the embers on the
earth, when the hearth was, as it is at the present
day in many Irish cottages, a true ‘focus,’ a centre
of accumulated heat. We must, then, return to
truer lines, and make our fireplace again a ‘focus’
or ‘well’ of stored heat, into which we put our
fuel, first to be distilled into gas, which, rising
at a high temperature from its hot bed, meets
the air gliding towards the chimney, and bursts
into flame, communicating heat to the firebrick
back and to the room. Then, when all the gases
have been burnt off, the red-hot coke remains,
and burns away in the bottom of the grate at
a slow rate, yet radiating abundant heat into the
room.</p>

<p>This desirable end is gained by using Mr Teale’s
‘Economiser.’ The ‘Coal Economiser’ is simply
a shield of sheet-iron which stands on the hearth,
and rises as high as the lowest bar of the grate,
against which it should fit accurately, so as to
shut in the space under the fire. Any ordinary
blacksmith can make the ‘Economiser.’ It is
applicable to any range, whether in the cottages
of the poor or the mansions of the rich. Those
who wish for greater elegance can have it made
of steel or brass. Its chief purpose is to cut off
the under current, and to keep the chamber under
the fire hot.</p>

<p>Count Rumford affirmed that seven-eighths of
the heat was carried up the chimney. Heat is
wasted in three ways: by combustion under the
influence of a strong draught; by imperfect combustion;
by the escape of heat through the sides
and the back of the fireplace. By using the
‘Economiser’ all this is altered. If there is
plenty of heat round the fuel, then but little
oxygen will do. But burn coal with a chilling
jacket, and it needs a fierce draught of oxygen
to sustain it. High temperature does not imply
complete combustion, for in making gas, coke is
left. When the ‘Economiser’ is applied, the
fire burns with an orange colour, for the stream
of oxygen is slow and steady, and the coal undergoes
complete combustion; consequently, there
is an entire absence of cinders, and only a little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_749">{749}</span>fine snuff-like powder falls into the ‘economised’
chamber. Smoke is also conspicuous by its
absence.</p>

<p>In a recent lecture delivered at the Royal
Institution, Mr Teale mentioned several additional
points about the structure of fireplaces,
which tend to the saving of fuel. (1) As much
firebrick and as little iron as possible should be
used. Iron absorbs the heat, and chiefly in
directions in which the heat is least wanted.
Firebrick retains and accumulates heat. (2) The
back of the fireplace should lean or arch over
the fire, so as to become heated by the rising
flame. The heated back sends forth abundant
radiant heat into the room. ‘Milner’s’ back is
a capital arrangement; so is the Nelson ‘Rifle’
back. (3) The bottom of the grating should be
deep from before backwards. (4) The slits in
the grating should be narrow; this prevents
small cinders from falling through. (5) The
bars in front should be narrow.</p>

<p>If the foregoing instructions are attended to,
there will be an enormous saving of fuel. Soot
and smoke will be diminished, and there will
be no half-burnt cinders.</p>

<p>The late Sir William Siemens was an ardent
advocate for the use of gas as a heating agent.
At the British Association of 1882, he said: ‘The
time is not far distant when both rich and poor
will largely resort to gas, the most convenient,
the cleanest, and cheapest of heating agents, and
when raw coal will only be seen at the colliery
or gasworks. In all cases where the town to
be supplied is within, say, thirty miles of the
colliery, the gasworks may with advantage be
placed at the mouth, or, still better, at the bottom
of the pit, whereby all haulage of fuel would
be avoided, and the gas in its ascent from the
bottom of the colliery would acquire an onward
pressure sufficient, probably, to impel it to its
destination.’ No doubt, if this scheme could be
realised, we would all be deeply indebted to the
great man who first suggested it. More than
one half of the coal now consumed would be
saved by its adoption. At present, we must be
content with the old order of things.</p>

<p>It is astonishing, however, that so few people
employ gas instead of coal as a cooking agent,
especially in summer. It secures an immense
saving of labour, not to speak of its superiority
over coal in respect to coolness. In the
hot summer days, cooking with a coal-fire in
an ordinary range is a tremendous trial to
the poor cook. The kitchen is like an oven.
What a difference if gas is used! The moment
it is no longer required it can be turned off,
and the temperature of the kitchen is soon
lowered. By using a gas-stove, no coal is required
during the summer. It is less expensive
than coal. Of course, care must be taken to have
it turned off directly it is no longer required,
and a proper economy exercised in its use. Mr
Fletcher, of Warrington, a high authority on
gas for cooking and heating purposes, says: ‘The
cost of gas, even if wastefully used, must be considered
not only as regards the saving of coal,
but also, what is far greater, the saving in weight
of meat roasted, which is considerable, and the
reduced wear and tear, waste, dirt, and consequent
labour. Taken altogether as affecting the
total housekeeping expenses, gas is cheaper than
coal for cooking at any price not exceeding twelve
or fourteen shillings per thousand cubic feet;
coal being, say, twelve to fourteen shillings per
ton.’ The majority of people, however, pay very
much less for their gas, and more for coal; in
which case, gas will be much cheaper than
coal.</p>

<p>Asbestos heated by gas makes a suitable fire.
It is cleanly, quiet, free from dust, and convenient;
and it can be turned on or extinguished
in an instant.</p>

<p>Enough has been written to show that economy
of fuel is not merely theoretical and
fanciful, but that it is practicable and worthy
of earnest attention.</p>




<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop"><div class="chapter"><h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_SIGN_OF_THE_RED_INDIAN">THE SIGN OF THE <i>RED INDIAN</i>.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Just</span> on the outskirts of the seaport and garrison
town of Chubleigh, in the south-west of England,
stands a little old-fashioned hostelry called the
<i>Red Indian</i>. How it came by its name is involved
in obscurity. The antiquity of the inn is undoubted,
and a tradition is current in the
district, that during the unfortunate Monmouth’s
rebellion it was used as the temporary head-quarters
of Colonel Kirke. In its back-garden,
a wooden seat is still shown to visitors on which
that bloodthirsty officer, surrounded by his
‘lambs,’ is alleged to have sat in judgment, and
thence ruthlessly consigned to the gallows scores
of the unoffending rustics of the locality. From
time immemorial, the <i>Red Indian</i> has been in
the hands of a family named Slade. The present
proprietor, though, generally speaking, as
deliberate in manner as John Willet, is yet
apt to be garrulously communicative in talking
of his inn and its interesting historical associations.
Above the rustic porch over the door
there is fixed a large, rudely carved, wooden
figure of a savage holding in its hand a tomahawk.
The Indian’s nose was long ago knocked
off by a well-directed stone thrown by some mischievous
urchin; his original coat of paint has
peeled off, and large cracks are visible, which run
the whole length of the figure. Altogether, this
Indian is as disreputable-looking a sign as a
traveller might perceive throughout the length
and breadth of England. Nevertheless, it is in
connection with this dilapidated timber savage
that the writer obtained, from the landlord of
the <i>Red Indian</i>, materials for the following
story.</p>

<p>When the present century was in its infancy,
the son of the then proprietor, and grand-uncle
of the present landlord, was engaged in the
capacity of boatswain of a privateer, which had
been fitted out with the object of preying on
the French merchant service. In the Mediterranean,
the privateer captured a large vessel,
which in part was laden with the product of the
labours of a Parisian curiosity-hunter, who had
been despoiling ancient Grecian temples, with the
object of supplying the virtuosi of the French
metropolis with antique sculptures and bronzes,
and thereby securing a large profit to himself.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_750">{750}</span>The privateersmen were greatly disappointed at
not finding specie, and what they considered
marketable merchandise, on board the Frenchman,
and attached but little value to the battered
though priceless bas-reliefs and statues. Boatswain
Slade took a great fancy to a life-sized
bronze gladiator, which he considered would
prove an acceptable addition to the attractions
of the back-garden of his father’s inn, and
managed, for a few shillings, to effect its purchase
from the captain.</p>

<p>Shortly after the glorious victory of Trafalgar,
the privateer was paid off at Chubleigh; and
the boatswain conveyed the statue on shore to
his father’s inn. The gladiator was placed on
a brick pedestal, flanked on either side by two
rusty carronades; and the bareness of the surroundings
was relieved by the artistic disposal
of a number of huge shells which the boatswain
had brought from ‘foreign parts.’ The host of
the <i>Red Indian</i>, however, was soon struck by the
idea of making the figure a sign for his hostelry.
He had but little sentimental regard for the rich
green mould of antiquity, so, with execrable
vandalism, carefully scraped it off the statue,
and had the gladiator painted a bright scarlet
by a local artist, who took payment for his work
in the old ale for which the hostelry was famous.
This operation performed, the metamorphosed
gladiator was removed to a prominent position
in front of the inn door, and for years did duty
as a Red Indian. Its brilliant appearance was a
perpetual source of gratification and delight to
the host and his numerous customers; while
inquiring strangers were proudly informed that
it had been captured from the frog-eaters. Once
a year the extemporised Indian received a fresh
coat of paint; and save when its head was decorated
at times with a disused tin pail or an old
hat by some facetious individuals, it was not
otherwise interfered with.</p>

<p>At the close of the year 1815, Chubleigh was
<i>en fête</i> in connection with the disembarkation of
the 31st Regiment of Light Dragoons, which
during that year had performed doughty service
at Waterloo, and which had just returned from
the occupation of Paris. The piping times of
peace had again returned, and, naturally enough,
the officers and men who had assisted to destroy
the power of the once dreaded ‘Boney’ were the
objects of popular pride and enthusiasm among
the inhabitants of the town. When the regiment
settled down in quarters, invitations to the houses
of the principal townsmen were showered on the
officers, and each vied with the other to entertain
these heroes of Waterloo.</p>

<p>The younger officers, several of whom had
left school to join their regiment in Belgium,
gave themselves prodigious airs; but no one
considered himself of so much importance as
a raw young Connaught-man, a cornet named
Mike Macnamara. Mike, a warrior of about
nine months’ service, created great amusement
both in the officers’ mess and in the houses to
which he was invited by boasting about the
number of Frenchmen whom he had placed
<i>hors de combat</i> in the late short but eventful
campaign. His bounce together with his extreme
simplicity rendered him the butt of his brother-officers,
and he was in consequence the victim
of numerous practical jokes. In these days,
and for many years subsequently, rough horseplay
and the perpetration of the most uncomfortable
imaginable practical jokes were characteristic
of the spirited gentlemen who officered
the regiments of British cavalry. Those of our
readers who took the trouble, some years ago,
to wade through the evidence at the Tichborne
trial, will remember the description of the ruthless
tricks played on the simple undoubted Roger
by his brother-carabineers. At the present day,
military practical joking is somewhat out of
fashion, and any games that may be played are
curtailed of their former disagreeable proportions,
and have assumed a comparatively mild character.</p>

<p>Cornet Macnamara’s room was the favourite
arena for a display of the ingenious tricks of his
facetiously inclined brother-officers. Thistles and
dead cats were placed between his sheets; trapfuls
of live rats were let loose in the apartment;
the nuts of his iron bedstead were unscrewed,
so that when the poor fellow turned in, the
framework of the couch tumbled to pieces and
landed the mattress on the floor, while at the
same time he was douched by a tub of water
from the shelf above, which was fastened with
cord to the mattress, and upset simultaneously
with the collapse of the bed. On such occasions
Mike was naturally wroth, and expressed himself
as anxious to call out the offenders; but
despite his utmost vigilance and caution, he could
never capture his tormentors.</p>

<p>Late one evening, a party of revellers from
barracks were passing the <i>Red Indian</i>, when
they espied the vermilioned gladiator. Nothing
would satisfy them but to feloniously remove
the statue and return with it to quarters—a
work of considerable difficulty, as the figure
was heavy. Arrived thither with their load,
some one suggested that it should be placed in
Cornet Macnamara’s room; and this idea was
hailed with general enthusiasm. A scout was
despatched to the messroom, in order to keep
watch on Mike’s movements, and give the alarm
in case he should appear on the scene. With
great labour the gladiator was hoisted to the
top of the staircase of the officer’s house; and
Mike’s room door having been forced open, the
jokers placed the statue in front of his dressing-table,
on the top of an inverted iron coal-box.
The staircase at the time was in process of being
whitewashed, so the officers obtained possession
of a tub of the mixture, and smeared the ‘Red
Indian’ a dirty white; then taking the sheets
from Mike’s bed, they hung them about the
figure, turning it into a respectable-looking ghost.
Afterwards, the officers dropped one by one into
the messroom, and joined a group who were
listening with great amusement to a new-fangled
story which was being retailed by Macnamara
regarding his prowess at Waterloo.</p>

<p>Mike, after clapping an additional two Frenchmen
to the previous grand total of the number
who had fallen by his sword, as narrated in
his tale of the previous night, left the messroom
in order to proceed to his quarters, whither,
in a minute or two, he was stealthily followed
by the whole of the officers, who anticipated
great fun from the consternation of their victim
when beholding the ghastly apparition in his bedroom.
Mike gaily entered the apartment, singing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_751">{751}</span>a love ditty of his native land, and began to
fumble for his tinder-box. After several attempts,
he at last managed to light his candle, and of
course at once perceived the ghost. The cornet
was filled with the superstitious notions of a
certain section of his countrymen, and started
back nearly overcome with terror. ‘Ye saints
in glory! what’s that?’ he cried; then leaving
the room, he plunged madly down the staircase,
and rushed yelling across the parade ground in
the direction of the messroom. In his headlong
progress, poor Mike did not observe a party
of two ladies and a gentleman, who happened
to be the colonel, accompanied by his wife and
daughter, who had just returned from a dinner-party.
Mike ran full tilt against his commanding
officer, and knocked him into a puddle in the
barrack square. The ladies screamed loudly;
and the colonel, with many objurgations, got on
his feet and confronted his assailant.</p>

<p>‘You—Cornet Macnamara!’ he angrily exclaimed.
‘What do you mean, sir, rushing about
like a madman at this time of night? Consider
yourself under arrest, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Faith, colonel,’ answered the unfortunate
Mike, ‘I am very sorry, sorr, but I did not
percaive ye. But, sorr, I wint up to me room
just now, and as I hope for salvation, I found
the divil in it, wid a big white shate wrapped
round him!’</p>

<p>The irate colonel at once surmised that another
trick had been played on his subordinate; so
he sent the ladies home to quarters, and then
called loudly for the sergeant of the guard with
a file of men.</p>

<p>When this detachment of the guard appeared
on the scene, the colonel ordered them to follow
him to Macnamara’s room, where, by the light
of the sergeant’s lantern, he showed the trembling
cornet that there was nothing supernatural in the
character of the figure that had frightened him
so much. He then, under the circumstances,
relieved Mike from arrest and proceeded home.</p>

<p>Mike waited until the commanding officer and
the men of the guard were clear of the staircase,
and then slid the gladiator off the coal-box.
He edged the statue to the top of the
stair, and by main strength toppled it over the
banister; and an instant later, with a loud crash,
the gladiator was smashed into fragments on the
flagstones of the lobby, four stories beneath.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that there was great
anger and consternation in the breast of the
worthy host of the <i>Red Indian</i> when, next
morning, he awoke and found that his cherished
statue had mysteriously disappeared. It was
not long, however, before he obtained a clew to
its whereabouts, as a customer informed him
that late the previous night he ‘met a lot
of milingtary chaps carrying summut’ in the
direction of the barracks. This ‘summut’ Mr
Slade shrewdly conjectured was his ‘Red Indian;’
and he at once wrote to the regimental quarters
to make inquiries into the matter.</p>

<p>When the poor landlord discovered the gladiator
in its fragmentary state, he became most angry
and abusive; but was somewhat consoled when
an emissary from the mess informed him that
the officers would make good the damage, and
requested him to inform them by letter next
day the price at which he valued his statue. The
landlord then procured the services of a passing
cart and had the pieces removed to the inn.
After a long consultation with his wife, he
decided to assess the damage at ten guineas;
and by way of making the most of the business,
communicated with a marine store-dealer in
town, intending to sell the smashed gladiator as
old metal.</p>

<p>The colonel made the most strenuous though
unavailing efforts to discover the practical jokers,
and roundly abused the whole of the mess for
their treatment of poor Mike; but after a while,
the affair passed off in a general laugh.</p>

<p>Affairs, however, were speedily fated to take
a turn which caused the implicated parties to
laugh the other way. A large vessel arrived in
the port of Chubleigh from Alexandria, which
had among her passengers a celebrated London
virtuoso, who, some months before, had been
induced to pay a visit to Egypt by reason of
the excitement produced in antiquarian circles
by the discoveries of the celebrated Belzoni.
This gentleman was posting to London when his
chaise broke down opposite the <i>Red Indian</i>, and
he entered the hostelry while the vehicle was
being repaired. After partaking of a little
refreshment, he took a walk in the garden, and
his eye caught the fragments of the gladiator,
which had been shot in a corner while waiting
the arrival of the marine store-dealer’s cart.
Having elicited the story of the statue from
the host, the antiquary submitted the pieces to
a most careful examination; and despite the
whitewash and coats of paint with which the
figure had been adorned, he recognised it as
a specimen of the work of the renowned ancient
Greek sculptor Lysippus; and in answer to
the excited inquiry of the astonished landlord,
appraised its value at six hundred pounds!</p>

<p>Having, at the host’s urgent request, given a
written opinion on the matter, the virtuoso
departed on his journey, and then Mr Slade
hurried with his certificate to a Chubleigh
attorney, in whose hands he placed the matter,
with instructions to leave no stone unturned to
recover the full amount from the officers.</p>

<p>Words could scarcely express the chagrin of
the purloiners of the gladiator, when the colonel
of the 31st Light Dragoons read at mess the
contents of the letter he received from the legal
adviser of the landlord of the <i>Red Indian</i>. The
commanding officer further significantly hinted
that the implicated parties would have to uphold
their reputation as officers and gentlemen by
paying the amount demanded, or run the risk
of being cashiered.</p>

<p>At first, the jokers were inclined to dispute
the claim, and invited the opinion of an expert;
but that authority, when he had inspected the
figure, corroborated the London man’s decision,
with a further assurance that the statue was
cheap at the money.</p>

<p>Cornet Macnamara, with reasonable show of
justification, stoutly declined to pay a farthing of
the six hundred pounds. It was, however, with
a very bad grace, indeed, that the sum was subscribed
by the interested parties; and served as
a valuable lesson to them to modify for the future
their spirit of mischief.</p>

<p>When Mike discovered the identity of his tormentors,
he sent a challenge to each, and an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_752">{752}</span>arrangement was come to by which a representative
was selected by ballot to meet the Irishman.
The old trick of leadless pistols was
resorted to; the combatants fired three shots
at each other without any perceptible result, and
then the seconds interfered, and declared honour
satisfied.</p>

<p>A Jew purchased the fragments of the gladiator
from the officers for a few guineas; but the wily
Israelite well knew that a genuine Lysippus is
almost as valuable broken as whole. He had
the pieces skilfully rejoined, and disposed of the
statue to a local virtuoso for a large sum,
who in turn bequeathed it to the Chubleigh
Museum.</p>

<p>With part of the money the lucky landlord
of the <i>Red Indian</i> received for his gladiator, he
invested in a wooden figure, which did duty for
a sign equally well, and which he placed above
the porch out of the reach of predatory officers,
and where, as has been mentioned, it still stands,
battered, cracked, and mouldy.</p>

<p>Shortly after the episode of the gladiator, the
31st Light Dragoons were hurriedly despatched
to Lancashire, in order to quell the bread riots
which had broken out in that county; and the
actors in the comedy just narrated were heard
of no more by the good folks of Chubleigh.</p>

<p>A little more remains to be told of the statue
by Lysippus. We must come down to 1851, the
year in which the Great Exhibition was held in
Hyde Park. A middle-aged Frenchman landed
at Chubleigh from Havre on his way to London,
and while taking a walk about the town, entered
the <i>Red Indian</i>. The landlord, who had profited
so handsomely by his statue, had years before
gone to his rest, and his son the ex-boatswain,
then an aged man, reigned in his stead. The
Frenchman was interested in learning that his
host had taken a share in the old war, and after
a time, he had narrated to him the whole history
of the statue.</p>

<p>‘Vat vas de name of de vessel you took?’ he
eagerly asked.</p>

<p>‘The <i>Hercules</i>, sir.’</p>

<p>To the landlord’s astonishment, Monsieur leant
back in his chair and indulged in a fit of uncontrollable
laughter, and recovering himself, asked
to be directed to the Museum. Having reached
that establishment, he was not long in picking
out the Lysippus, of which the learned in Chubleigh
were so proud. The Frenchman put on his
glasses and examined the gladiator’s toe-nail, and
then gave vent to another guffaw, which speedily
brought round him the officials of the establishment.
He asked to see the secretary; and when
introduced to the presence of that functionary,
exclaimed: ‘Begar, sir, dat gladiateur is no more
a Lysippus dan I am de Czar Nicholas of all
de Russias. My oncle, who die ven I vas a
leetle boy, keep vat you call a foundree in Athens,
and have casts, or <i>replicas</i> you call dem, made
of all de antiques. He den put dem down a
sewer until dey get a green magnifique; dey
look like de real article; and he make heaps of
money by selling dem as such in Paris. Your
gladiateur is one of dem!’</p>

<p>‘But, my dear sir,’ asked the astounded secretary,
‘how are you going to substantiate your
statement?’</p>

<p>‘Come wit me,’ said the Frenchman; and the
twain proceeded to the statue. ‘My oncle,’ resumed
the Frenchman, ‘deal in de antique, as I
have told you; and in case he himself be cheated
wit his own spurious statues, he have a private
mark. Here is dis mark—a leetle hole drilled
under dis toe-nail!’</p>

<p>The secretary communicated the purport of
Monsieur’s statement to the Museum directors;
experts were called who substantiated the Frenchman’s
assertion that the work was spurious, and
was no more the production of Lysippus than
an Italian moulder’s plaster-cast of Venus is
the work of Phidias. In disgust, the directors
ordered the statue to be transferred to the lumber-room
of the establishment, and its description,
‘Gladiator, by Lysippus, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> about 324; bequeathed
by the late ——, Esq.,’ disappeared from
the Museum catalogue.</p>




<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop"><div class="chapter"><h2 class="nobreak smalltext" id="ANOTHER_SHIP-CANAL">ANOTHER ‘SHIP-CANAL.’</h2></div>


<p>Another has been proposed, although the idea
is not new, but seems to have been an old idea
revived, and that is, to cut a canal from the sea
to Birkenhead Docks across the low flat country
lying between the outfalls of the Dee and Mersey,
and thus getting a wide passage which will
enable ships to avoid the bar of the Mersey.
Elaborate plans have been prepared by an eminent
engineer; and as the whole scheme seems feasible,
and as money for great schemes seems to be
readily forthcoming in this wealth-producing
country, there can be no reason why the ‘ship-canal
of Birkenhead’ should not be carried out
as well as the ‘ship-canal of Manchester.’ It
would have a great and reviving effect on the
town of Birkenhead, which by this means may
one day become an important commercial city, a
rival to, instead of a mere suburb of, her
wealthy sister on the opposite Lancastrian shore;
and the expectations of half a century ago of a
grand city, with magnificent streets, and squares,
and splendid commercial docks, may even yet be
realised.</p>
